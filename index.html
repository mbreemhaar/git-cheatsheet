            <p>Git is a powerful version control system that can be overwhelming for beginners. A Git cheat sheet is a
                valuable tool to quickly access the most commonly used Git commands and options. This cheat sheet covers
                essential Git commands to help you become more productive in your development workflow.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Setting_up_a_new_repository">
            <header>Setting up a new repository</header>
            <p>The easiest way to set up a new repository is to run <code>git init</code> in the directory where you
                want your
                project files to be. The <code>git init</code> command is especially useful when you already have an
                existing
                project that is not in a git repository yet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another way to set up your git repository, is making a new repository on GitHub. GitHub will provide you
                with a repository URL that you can use to clone the repository to your computer. You can do this by
                simply
                running <code>git clone your-repository-url</code> in the directory where you want your repository to
                live.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class=" main-section" id="Committing_changes">
            <header>Committing changes</header>
            <p>After making some changes to your codebase, you can commit them to the repository. To do this, you will
                first have to stage your changes. You can do this with <code>git add path/to/file</code>. Here, you
                can replace <code>path/to/file</code> with the file path to your changed files. You can also use
                <code>git add .</code> to add all changed files in your current working directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there is anything staged that you do not want to commit just yet, you can use
                <code>git reset HEAD -- path/to/file</code> to remove a file from the staging area.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are happy with the staged files, you can use <code>git commit -m "Your description here"</code>
                with a short description of your changes to commit them to your repository.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Working_with_branches">
            <header>Working with branches</header>
            <p>
                The possibility of using branches is one of the most powerful features of git. You can use branches to
                work on a part of the code while others are working on other parts of the same codebase. By working on
                different branches, your changes will not affect your colleagues until the code is merged to a main or
                master branch.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can make a new branch with <code>git branch branch-name</code>. After doing this, you can move to
                the new branch using <code>git checkout branch-name</code>. To see a list of all available branches in
                your local repository, simply use <code>git branch</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you want to merge the changes of your branch to another branch, you first have to go to the branch
                you want to merge your changes to with <code>git checkout branch-name</code>. After doing this, you can
                merge the changes of your branch with <code>git merge branch-name</code>.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Using_a_remote_repository">
            <header>Using a remote repository</header>
            <p>
                Remote repositories are another powerful feature of git. Using remote repositories, you can synchronize
                your repository with one on a git server, for example GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you used <code>git clone</code> to initialize your repository, you already have your remote branch
                set up. Otherwise, you can connect your local repository to a remote one with
                <code>git remote add origin your-repository-url</code>. This will add a remote repository with the name
                <code>origin</code>, which is the standard name for a remote repository.
            </p>
            <p>
                After connecting a remote repository, you can <i>pull</i> any changes from the remote repository using
                <code>git pull</code>. Equally, you can <i>push</i> your own changes using <code>git push</code>.
